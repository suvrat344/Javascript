      Create a countdown loop starting at a dynamic value of 10.
      1. Set the start variable at a value of 10, which will be used as the starting value for the loop.
      2. Create a function that takes one argument, which is the countdown value.
      3. Within the function, output the current value of the countdown into the console.
      4. Add a condition to check if the value is less than 1; if it is, then return the function.
      5. Add a condition to check if the value of the countdown is not less than 1, then continue to loop by calling the function within itself.
      6. Make sure you add a decrement operator on the countdown so the preceding condition eventually will be true to end the loop. Every time it loops, the value will decrease until it reaches 0.
      7. Update and create a second countdown using a condition if the value is greater than 0. If it is, decrease the value of the countdown by 1.
      8. Use return to return the function, which then invokes it again and again until the condition is no longer true.
      9. Make sure, when you send the new countdown value as an argument into the function, that there is a way out of the loop by using the return keyword and a condition that continues the loop if met.
